# The entries of this file are _not_ tracked by git version control. 
# Generally, you should not need to edit this file. The reason whey we do
# not track and backup files such as these is because they are either
# specific to your computer (and not helpful if you tried to use another computer)
# or are files automatically generated from your work by the underlying
# Python language and libraries and not worth including in your backups.
